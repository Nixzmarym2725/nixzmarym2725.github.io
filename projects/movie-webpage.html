            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project </h1>
          
            <p> In thew class of SEP my partner(Bobby) nand I were assigned to make a movie based on our knowlege one HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). The title of our movie webpage is Huanted Love.</p>
            
            <p>  We created a webpage using the genres Horror and romance,So we created a movie website with fictional characters (Colten,Arden,Cody) who all have a love-jealous relationship and end up in a horrible situation. We worked together to accomplish our movie. Both of us worked on different parts of the project, we made sure that we both checked on each other to see if we both liked what we were adding to the project. While using HTML we made sure to use headings, paragraph,div(s),span(s), our own google fonts, inputs, and also a submit button. When we used CSS in our movie we included a background color, margin, padding, borders, CSS selectors: element/class/id, and images. This is what we added to our project in order to make our movie webpage. As to when it came to making the webpage was a whole other challenge not thinking about what the context was going to be about but making sure we include as much details without making it so long. And the last challenge that we faced was making sure all the HTML & CSS worked together. Overall everything came out good because my partner and I had good communication.</p>
          
            <p> When we made this movie-webpage there were some challenges that we faced, there were also things that we  learned one main thing that I learned was COMMUNICATION. This helped because it made the project easier. Challenges that we faced were about like what our movie was going to be based on, Some other challenges that we faced were how to include div(s) and span(s). This was hard to include because we really dont use them so we didn't know exactly where to put them.

            <h2> Takeaways <h2>
              
              <li> COMMUNICATION is key
